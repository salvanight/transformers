# Project Title: Python/Rust Hybrid for Efficient Tensor Operations (Example)

A brief description of the project, its purpose (e.g., to leverage Rust for performance-critical tensor operations in a Python application), and its main goals.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a structure for integrating Rust code, specifically for tensor operations, into a Python application. It uses PyO3 for Rust-Python bindings and Maturin for building and packaging.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

-   `py_src/`: Contains Python application code that might use the Rust extension.
-   `rust_crates/`: Parent directory for all Rust crates.
    -   `Cargo.toml`: Rust workspace manifest.
    -   `tensor_ops_rs/`: An example Rust crate for tensor operations.
        -   `Cargo.toml`: Manifest for the `tensor_ops_rs` crate.
        -   `src/lib.rs`: Rust library code, including PyO3 bindings.
-   `tests/`: Contains tests.
    -   `python/`: Python integration tests for the Rust extension.
    -   `rust/`: Directory for any Rust integration tests (beyond unit tests within crates).
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python packaging configuration, specifying Maturin as the build backend.
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
-   `README.md`: This file.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.x
    *   Rust toolchain (rustup, cargo)
    *   `pip` for installing Python packages.

2.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).

3.  **Install Maturin**:
    ```bash
    pip install maturin
    ```

4.  **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    # pip install -r requirements.txt # If you add a requirements.txt for Python deps
    ```

5.  **Development Install**:
    To build the Rust extension and make it available in your current Python environment for development:
    ```bash
    maturin develop
    ```
    Any changes to the Rust code will require re-running this command. For faster iterative development with some Rust tools, you might work directly within the Rust crate and run `cargo build` and `cargo test` there.

## Building the Project

-   **Development Build**:
    As mentioned above, use `maturin develop` for an editable install.

-   **Release Build (Wheel)**:
    To create a Python wheel that can be distributed and installed:
    ```bash
    maturin build --release
    ```
    This will produce a `.whl` file in `target/wheels/`. You can then install this wheel using `pip install target/wheels/<your_wheel_name>.whl`.

## Testing

This project uses a combination of Rust unit tests and Python integration tests.

### Rust Unit Tests

Rust unit tests for the `tensor_ops_rs` crate are located within the crate itself, typically either inline with the code in `rust_crates/tensor_ops_rs/src/lib.rs` or in a separate `tests` module within the crate (e.g., `rust_crates/tensor_ops_rs/src/tests.rs` or `rust_crates/tensor_ops_rs/tests/`).

To run Rust unit tests:
```bash
cd rust_crates/tensor_ops_rs
cargo test
cd ../.. # Return to project root
```
Or, to run tests for all crates in the workspace:
```bash
cd rust_crates
cargo test --all
cd .. # Return to project root
```

### Python Integration Tests

Python tests are used to verify the behavior of the compiled Rust extension from the Python side. These tests are located in the `tests/python/` directory. We recommend using a framework like `pytest`.

To run Python integration tests:

1.  **Build and install the development version of the package:**
    Make sure you have `maturin` installed (`pip install maturin`).
    From the project root directory:
    ```bash
    maturin develop
    ```
    This command builds the Rust extension and installs it in your current Python environment in an editable way.

2.  **Run pytest:**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/python
    ```

Ensure you have `pytest` installed in your Python environment (`pip install pytest`).
The `tests/python/__init__.py` file allows this directory to be treated as a Python package.
The `tests/rust/` directory is available for any broader Rust integration tests that might span multiple crates or require more setup than unit tests, though for a single library crate, unit tests are often sufficient. It contains a `.gitkeep` file to ensure it's tracked by Git.

## Integrating a Rust Tensor Library

The primary goal of the Rust extension (`tensor_ops_rs_py`) is to provide efficient tensor operations. To achieve this, you will need to choose and integrate a Rust tensor library.

1.  **Choose a Library**: Popular choices include:
    *   `ndarray`: For n-dimensional arrays, similar to NumPy.
    *   `tch-rs`: For libtorch (PyTorch) bindings, allowing you to work with PyTorch tensors in Rust.
    *   Other specialized libraries depending on your needs.

2.  **Add Dependency**: Add your chosen library to `rust_crates/tensor_ops_rs/Cargo.toml` under the `[dependencies]` section. For example:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    pyo3 = { version = "0.21.0", features = ["extension-module"] }
    # ndarray = "0.15" # Example for ndarray
    # tch = "0.14"     # Example for tch-rs
    ```
    (The `Cargo.toml` already contains these commented examples).

3.  **Implement Logic**: Use the chosen tensor library within `rust_crates/tensor_ops_rs/src/lib.rs` to implement your desired tensor functions, exposing them to Python via PyO3.

## Usage

(Placeholder)
Describe how to import and use the `tensor_ops_rs_py` module in Python once it's built and installed. For example:

```python
# In your Python code (e.g., in py_src/main.py)
try:
    from tensor_ops_rs_py import example_function # Assuming you add 'example_function'
    # result = example_function(1, 2)
    # print(f"Result from Rust: {result}")
    print("Successfully imported 'tensor_ops_rs_py'. Add functions to use it!")
except ImportError:
    print("Could not import 'tensor_ops_rs_py'. Ensure it's built and installed.")

# TODO: Add actual usage examples once functions are implemented in Rust.
```
